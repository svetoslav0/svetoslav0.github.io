                        In the past two years, a wave of distressing commentary has stressed the fragility of American democracy and the potential, inspired by President Trump, for emerging authoritarianism. But a year into the Trump administration, Americans are rejecting authoritarian alternatives to democracy. In a new survey by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, we found that the percentage of Americans who expressed support for a “strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections or Congress”.

                    <p>
                        Winters in the United States have gotten warmer in the past 30 years, and some of the coldest parts of the country have warmed up the most. In Minnesota, winters between 1989 and 2018 were an average of 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, compared to a 20th century baseline, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed by The New York Times. Florida’s winters were 1.4 degrees warmer, on average, during that time.

                        There are a lot of ways to run afoul of local laws in this town. You can enter a park after the posted closing hour, or fail to clean 18 inches into the street in front of your house, or install a toilet without a permit, or let your poodle’s rabies vaccine expire. You can spit on the sidewalk, or urinate on the sidewalk or drink a beer on the sidewalk or leave your trash can on the sidewalk before 4 p.m. on the eve of collection day. Last year, not counting parking and red-light tickets, the city handed out more than 877,000 noncriminal summonses.
